# nixos-config

A NixOS configuration using Nix flakes.

## Hosts

1. **Steel** - My gaming machine. Very incomplete as of now; I plan to flesh it out once I learn how to use home-manager.
2. **Night** - My server, on which I plan to host several services via Podman.
3. **Nixos-test** - A development configuration where changes are tested before being pushed to either of the above.
